NAME
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ImageMirror - A PoCo-IRC plugin which
    uploads select images to a mirror service

SYNOPSIS
     use POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ImageMirror;

     # mirror all images from 4chan.org
     $irc->plugin_add(ImageMirror => POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ImageMirror->new(
         URI_match => [
             qr{4chan\.org/\w+/src/.*(?i:jpe?g|gif|png)$},
         ],
     ));

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ImageMirror is a POE::Component::IRC
    plugin. It looks for image URLs in the channel log and uploads the
    images to Imageshack, then prints a short description of the image along
    with the new URL.

METHODS
  "new"
    Takes the following optional arguments:

    'Channels', an array reference of channels names. If you don't supply
    this, images will be mirrored in all channels.

    'URI_match', an array reference of regex objects. Any url found must
    match at least one of these regexes if it is to be uploaded. If you
    don't supply this parameter, a default regex of
    "qr/(?i:jpe?g|gif|png)$/" is used.

    'URI_subst', an array of regex/string pairs. These substitutions will be
    done on the accepted URIs before they are processed further.

    Example:

     # always fetch 7chan images via http, not https
     URI_subst => [
         qr{(?<=^)https(?=://(?:www\.)?7chan\.org)} => 'http',
     ]

    'Method', how you want messages to be delivered. Valid options are
    'notice' (the default) and 'privmsg'.

    Returns a plugin object suitable for feeding to POE::Component::IRC's
    "plugin_add" method.
