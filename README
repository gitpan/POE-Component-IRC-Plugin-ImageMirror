    uploads select images to a mirror service

SYNOPSIS
     use POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ImageMirror;

     $irc->plugin_add(ImageMirror => POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ImageMirror->new(

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ImageMirror is a POE::Component::IRC
    plugin. It looks for image URLs in the channel log and uploads the
    images to Imageshack and Imgur, then prints a short description of the
    image along with the new URLs.

    This plugin makes use of POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::URI::Find. An
    instance will be added to the plugin pipeline if it is not already
    present.

METHODS
  "new"
    Takes the following optional arguments:

    'Channels', an array reference of channels names. If you don't supply
    this, images will be mirrored in all channels.

    'URI_match', an array reference of regex objects. Any url found must
    match at least one of these regexes if it is to be uploaded. If you
    don't supply this parameter, a default regex of
    "qr/(?i:jpe?g|gif|png)$/" is used.

    'URI_subst', an array of regex/string pairs. These substitutions will be
    done on the accepted URIs before they are processed further.

    Example:

     # always fetch 7chan images via http, not https
     URI_subst => [
         qr{(?<=^)https(?=://(?:www\.)?7chan\.org)} => 'http',
     ]

    'URI_title', whether or not to include a title produced by URI::Title.
    Defaults to true.

    'Imgur_user', an Imgur username. If provided, the images will uploaded
    to Imgur will be under this account rather than anonymously.

    'Imgur_pass', an Imgur account password to go with 'ImgurUser'.

    'Method', how you want messages to be delivered. Valid options are
    'notice' (the default) and 'privmsg'.

    'Eat', when enabled, will prevent further processing of
    "irc_urifind_uri" events by other plugins for URIs which this plugin
    mirrors. False by default.

    Returns a plugin object suitable for feeding to POE::Component::IRC's
    "plugin_add" method.
